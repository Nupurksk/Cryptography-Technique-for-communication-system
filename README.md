# Cryptography-Technique-for-communication-system


Secure Communication of message from sender to receiver is one of the
main security concern of Internet users across world.
❑ It is because of the regular attacks and threats and most Important Data
Privacy. In order to sort out these issues, we use cryptographic algorithm
which encrypts data in some cipher and transfers it over the internet and
again decrypted to original data.
❑ Thus, lightweight cryptography methods are proposed to overcome many
of the problems of conventional cryptography
❑ Ciphers act as encapsulating system for message. Hybrid Algorithm will
be formed from use of different types of ciphers.
❑ The cryptosystem performs its encryption by encrypting the plaintext using
Vigenere Cipher and further again processing though Polybius Cipher
